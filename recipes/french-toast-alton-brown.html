        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Soaked in a creamy custard sweetened with honey, this comforting and easy French toast is best served with a hefty drizzle of maple syrup.</p>

        <p>To make extra-crunchy French toast, dredge the battered bread in crushed cornflakes or Frosted Flakes before cooking.</p>
