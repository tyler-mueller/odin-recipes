        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This lemon-herb chicken is a simple, quick, and delicious dish. All you need are a few herbs, a lemon, and of course, the chicken! The amount of spices is completely up to you. You can add more or less according to your taste.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (5oz) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, juiced, divided</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a bowl; pour 1/2 of the lemon juice over chicken and season with salt.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Place chicken into hot oil. Add remaining lemon juice and oregano; season with black pepper. Cook chicken until golden brown and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Garnish chicken with parsley to serve.</li>
        </ol>
