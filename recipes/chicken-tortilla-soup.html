    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Loaded with corn and beans, this soup is hearty enough for a main meal. Save time by topping it with purchased tortilla chips.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into 1/2 inch strips</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 (15oz) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (15oz) can whole kernel corn, drained</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite sized pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salsa</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add half of the tortilla strips, stirring often, until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil and remaining tortilla strips and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, cumin, chili powder and oregano to the pot. Raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Add the beans, corn, chicken and salsa. Reduce heat to low, stir and simmer for about 2 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.</li>
        <li>Add the cilantro and half of the reserved tortilla strips. Ladle into individual bowls and garnish each bowl with some of the remaining strips.</li>
    </ol>
