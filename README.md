# odin-recipes
A basic recipes website using html from The Odin Project

This project will consist of a basic html website that hosts cooking recipes.
It will have a main index page that links to the recipes and pages for the 
recipes themselves.

The skills I will demonstrate in completing this project are:
 - Building html pages from the html boilerplate
 - Using proper file structure to keep the website organized
 - Using relative links between the index page and the recipe pages
 - Using html headings to title the site and the recipes
 - Using unordered lists for ingredients and the recipe links
 - Using ordered lists to provide the steps for the recipes
 - Adding images and their alt text to show desired recipe outcomes
